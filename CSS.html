	<b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a <a target="blank "href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">website</a> for the Internet <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">(World Wide Web)</a> or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.<br>
<sup>[1]</sup><b>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.</b><sup>[2]</sup><b> Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.<br></b></p>
<p id="para1">
For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">(Web developers)</a> and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<hr>
